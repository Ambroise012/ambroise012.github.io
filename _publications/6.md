excerpt: >
    This project was mmade during my interniship in Copenhagen (ITU). \\
    
    Nowadays, it has become common practice to measure all our energy consumption during a project, when executing code. Energy is an analytical tool and it has become essential to measure our consumption.\\

    What should we measure? How is energy measured? Is there a link between energy in joules and CO2 emissions in kg? What tools do we have to measure? And finally, how can we reduce the emissions from our project? These are the questions I'm going to answer. \  
    
    I invite you to consult my github repository.\\
