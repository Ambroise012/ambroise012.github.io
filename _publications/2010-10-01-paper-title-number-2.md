excerpt: "Here you'll find a presentation of the 'mini-project' completed during the 2nd year of the Signal and Electronics for Music option. It involves remaking the shazam algorithm. As the project was only 12 hours long, we weren't able to do everything we'd have liked. [Link to the project github.](https://github.com/Nyries/ShazamWish.git) Briefly, how the shazam alogorithm works:  
1. extract the song's spectrogram 
2. keep only the "peaks" (points of highest intensity)
3. establishment of the fingerprint from the distances between these "vertices 
4. comparison with the database"
