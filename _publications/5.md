title: "BERT - Pruning"
collection: publications
permalink: publications/bert-pruning
excerpt: >
    This paper is the report that I made during my interniship in Copenhagen. 
    This report addresses structured pruning. This means that the weights of the model are adjusted during training. Additionally, I have incorporated other optimization methods into pruning, such as distillation, and I have also compared two methods: one with a "classic" fine-tuning and the other using adapters.
