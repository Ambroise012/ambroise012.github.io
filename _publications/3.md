    This paper is the report of the 2nd year project at ENSEA. \\
    
    The use of weedkillers and other chemical products is becoming a major problem in agriculture today. We therefore need to find a way of identifying weeds as soon as they are young shoots, in order to eliminate them immediately. But how can we identify them? \\

    That's the aim of this project, to develop an AI model that is the most relevant for this purpose. We are studying several image recognition architectures. We are comparing the CNN with YOLOv8 according to several criteria we have set ourselves.\\
