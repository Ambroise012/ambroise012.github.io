    Report of my 3rd year project at ENSEA. \\
    The project deals with spurious correlation. The aim is to increase model's robustness to spurious correlation. 
    NLP models tend to rely on spurious correlation between labels and input features. Shortcut learning or spurious correlation refer to ”biased words” that disproportionately influence predictions. 
    This work first proposes several identification methods and then a two-step fine tuning on BERT model, using classification task. 
    This study compares three identifying methods based on forgettable example, important feature and using LID.
