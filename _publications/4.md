excerpt: >
    This paper is the report that I made during my interniship in Copenhagen. 
    It deals about the energy cost and type of pruning used in Natural Langage Processing. \\
    I have carried out a state of the art review of the available methods for measuring energy. Then I put into practice a first example of unstructured pruning on the Llama model. And using the algorithm, Wanda and Magnitude pruning.\\
